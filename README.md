# VSC Supervirbonic Transitions

Source code and post-processing files of the following work:

- Theory of Supervibronic Transitions via Casimir Polaritons. Tao E. Li. 2024

Please go to **plotting/** and run each Python script (**plot_fig\*\*.py**) to plot the figures corresponding to the main text. 

Note that, for data corresponding to the SI, because the original output files are not included in this Github repo due to the space limit, the users may encounter errors when running the Python scripts for plotting the SI figures (**plot_si\*\*.py**). To resolve this issue, please go to **semiclassical/jobs_fulldm/** and **semiclassical/jobs_vib_orientations/**, run the Python files **submit_jobs_\*\*.py**. The raw output data for the SI will be generated accordingly.
